## About

I'm a text editor lover but anything like Neovim. At first, it was challenging for me to adapt to all the new keybdingins and stuff, but now I can use this for improve my workflow as a developer. And you can too!

## Requirements

### You will need:
 - [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) (the rc from 2 years ago can be used with [vim](https://www.vim.org/));
